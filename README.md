## Hi It's Bay!

My roomate and I started an addiction that could be worse. Over the year we have learned some techiques and strategies to keep the indoor plants alive during winter at James Madison University since it is typically cold, low hunitity, and low light.

### Tips for indoor plant beginners  

Before buying a plant, make sure you have the following:
1. Good lighting:
Plants need sunlight to survive. Make sure you have a designated area where there is visible and constant sunlight for your plant before buying one. I recomment putting the plant near a window. That means you have to remember to open your blinds everyday! If you choose to locate the plant in a different area, make sure every so often you move it to a sunny area for a couple hours everyday to every other day or buy a reliable plant light. Lastly, roate your plants weekly or else the plants will lean towards the sun. 
      
2. Watering: Beginners typically think that you water your plants based off a schedule. This is not the case. Each plant is very different and needs its own special attention. To know when you should water your plants, check the soil. If the first one to two inches feels dry, it is time to water! Each plant needs a certain amount of water based off the type of plant, size, amount of sunlight, and environment. With that being said, I recommend keeping all of your plants in a pot with holes at the bottom to filter our excess water. Then you can set the plant in a bucket of water and it will absorb as much as it needs naturally. Make sure it is purified/clean water so it does not get a disease and die. Overtime you will get fimiliar with each plants routine and it will get much simpler! 

3. Fertilizer/Food: Plants need more than just water and lighting. Once you buy your plant, every three months you need to change the potting soil and add a big pinch of fertilizer on the top layer of the soil. Also, to give your plants more minerals to thrive you can buy plant food that you mix in your water when watering. I have created my own food by putting banana peels in a large mason jar full of water. I let it fermentate for a couple of days and add it to my planting water.

4. Humitity: Since James Madison University is not typically humid, especially in the winter, I recommend getting a humidifier. This is becasue dry air leads to dry plants.  

5. Temperature: I know you might feel comfortable with the temperature of your home but your plant may not. When you get in bed at night do you crave the crisp cold so you can bundle up in your sheets? Well so do plants. You might not know, but plants do not like a constant temperature. During they day they prefer warm temperatures around 70-78 degrees, but, at night they like to rest just like us. I like to call this there bedtime. Before bed turn down the temperature a notch or two so the plant can relax. Another way to think of it is thinking about outdoor plants. During the day it gets warmer and at night it begins to cool. It is there natural way of living and most plants are accustomed to this process, even indoor plants. Keep in mind, though, that during the winter windows tend to let in cold temperatures. Move the plants away from it during extreme cold weather.

6. Soil: Soil is a little tricky. At first I would buy basic, universal potting soil from the store but noticed my plants werent getting enough aeration. The best type of potting soil will include peat moss, ground pine bark, perlite, and fertilizer. I tend to buy the organic soil to avoid chemicals and pesticides. Also, at the store you will notice that there are soils specific to certain plants. For example, succulents and cactus require little water so the soil does not need things like moss to keep in more moisture.
